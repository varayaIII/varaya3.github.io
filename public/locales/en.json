  "about_page_title": "About Me - Víctor Araya",
  "about_main_title": "My Work Philosophy",
  "about_p1": "I'm Víctor Araya, a family man and a self-taught systems engineer focused on the Cloud ecosystem. My journey in technology has taught me a fundamental lesson: the most robust systems are not those that never fail, but those designed to be resilient, observable, and able to recover quickly.",
  "about_subtitle1": "From the \"How\" to the \"Why\"",
  "about_p2": "My passion for DevOps was born from a curiosity to go beyond simply executing tasks. Instead of asking, \"how do I deploy this application?\", I began to wonder, \"how do we build a system that allows for safe, automated deployments at any time with minimal human intervention?\".",
  "about_p3": "This question led me to delve into the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), continuous delivery (CI/CD), and observability. I see technology not as an end in itself, but as a means to achieve crucial business objectives: agility, stability, and trust.",
  "about_subtitle2": "Culture of Continuous Improvement",
  "about_p4": "I adopt an iterative improvement mindset in everything I do. I firmly believe that automation is the key to unlocking human potential, allowing teams to focus on innovation rather than crisis management. To me, a well-designed CI/CD pipeline or an idempotent Terraform script are more than just tools; they are the embodiment of a culture that values consistency, predictability, and collaboration.",
